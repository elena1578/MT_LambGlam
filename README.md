Final Project for Media and Technology Spring 2023: Interactive Story (The Wolf and the Seven Lambs)

Team name: Lamb Glam
Team members: Elena Sipes, Sophia Kateyln Ramirez
Title of fairytale: The Wolf and the Seven Lambs 
We have chosen the scene where the the wolf reaches the door of the lambs' house and is about to enter, so the lambs have to hide from the wolf. For enclosure building purposes, we have narrowed it down to four lambs that will hide in a closet, oven, dresser, and bed. When the blue lamb is placed into the oven, a servo will spin around with a speech bubble that says "I'm the safest!" to imply that, once the wolf enters the house, the will be the only lamb that is not found and eaten by the wolf. Thus, once all the lambs are hidden, the user will move the wolf closer to the door that will spin around a servo that says "I'm going to eat you!".
